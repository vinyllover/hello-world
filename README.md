# hello-world
my first github repository
created by Chris
I am a SAS programmer in a non-SAS world. 
Looking to learn other programming languages 
and other looking forward to solving other
types of programming problems

Here I am again.  Decided to start again from 
the beginning.  It has been so long since I 
created my hello-world github rep
